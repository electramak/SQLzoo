# SQLzoo
This is a repository with my solutions to the SQLZoo exercises (https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)

SQLZOO is an online wiki containing a hands-on tutorial for SQL.

Each folder matches each unit of the tutorial.

This is my first handson experience with SQL. I suggest that you use my 
solutions only after you have tried to solve the exercises yourself!
